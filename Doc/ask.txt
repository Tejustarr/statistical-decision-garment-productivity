Project Overview
Dataset: Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees (UCI ML Repository, 2020)

Industry: Garment Manufacturing

Timeframe: Data recorded daily for the year 2015

Focus: Understand factors affecting employee productivity

üì¶ Dataset Features
Date

Quarter (Q1 to Q4, ignore Quarter 5)

Department (Sewing or Finishing)

Day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday‚Ä¶)

Team

Targeted Productivity (Productivity target to achieve)

SMV (Standard Minute Value ‚Äî time to complete a garment)

WIP (Work in Progress)

Over_time (Overtime minutes)

Incentive (Monetary incentive)

Idle_time (Idle minutes)

Idle_men (Idle workers)

No_of_style_change

No_of_workers

Actual Productivity (Achieved productivity)

üéØ Project Objective
Examine dataset structure

Explore relationships between variables

Identify factors impacting productivity (e.g., overtime, team size, department, day of the week, etc.)

Provide actionable insights for managerial decision-making

üìä Specific Analyses Required
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics for numerical variables

Count of working days, quarters

Mean, standard deviation, and histograms for actual productivity by:

Quarter

Department

Counts for department, teams, SMV

Histograms & Boxplots for productivity based on:

Day of the week

Team size

Quarter

Correlation matrix + heatmap

Conclusions on:

Target achievement

Incentives vs. productivity

Overtime effect

Department-wise & quarter-wise productivity relationship

üî¨ Hypothesis Testing Required
Z-Test: Is finishing department productivity > 0.75?

Z-Test: Is sewing department productivity > 0.75?

Two-Sample T-Test: Is finishing dept productivity > sewing dept?

Two-Sample T-Test (small sample): Does finishing dept get higher incentives?

Chi-Square Test: Does the actual low/medium/high productivity distribution match manager's belief in sewing dept?

ANOVA: Do different quarters impact actual productivity?

Two-Way ANOVA: Do day and quarter impact productivity?

Refined ANOVA: Eliminate insignificant factor, test with department variable

üìù Final Deliverables
Agree/Disagree with findings based on EDA & Hypothesis tests

Summarized insights

Recommendations to improve productivity in the garment industry
